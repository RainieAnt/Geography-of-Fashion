# 👗 Geography-of-Fashion

> Short one-line description or tagline for your project.

## 🗺️ Introduction
This is a digital geography and storytelling project designed to map, analyze, and visually narrate the evolution of New York Fashion Week (NYFW) across the city. Built with ArcGIS StoryMap and GitHub for project documentation, it provides an interactive, visually engaging exploration of how fashion and urban geography intersect.

The geography of these runways mirrors New York’s own evolution: from Manhattan’s iconic avenues to Brooklyn’s rising creative districts, each venue reflects shifting cultural, economic, and urban landscapes.

This project traces NYFW’s spatial journey through time, visualizing how runway locations move with the city’s changing identity, economic pressures, and cultural shifts. Through interactive maps, curated timelines, and narrative analysis, the StoryMap reveals how New York’s fashion landscape literally reshaped itself across decades.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Visualize the Evolution of NYFW

- Connect Fashion to Urban Geography

- Highlight Cultural and Economic Context

- Tell a Cohesive Story Through Mapping

- Show Fashion as a Reflection of Geography

## ⚠️ Limitations 

- Dataset includes only major, well-documented NYFW shows.

- Independent and emerging designers are excluded due to limited public data.

- Map reflects the documented core of NYFW, not its full decentralized network.

These limitations sharpen the focus and highlight NYFW’s major geographic arcs and evolution across the city.

## Method

So, how did we create this map? Below is an explanation:

First, we looked online for an interesting angle.

Then, when we tound that angle, we Scarced to do some research and gacher visualizacions.

When we got some ideas, then we started to play around with the widget in Arcgis storymap. Here is what we decided to include

- Feature 1: explain what it is and the steps it took to create it. use screenshots
- Feature 2: same
- So on
- and so on
