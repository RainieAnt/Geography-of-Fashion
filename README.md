# 👗 Fashion in Motion: Mapping the Urban Geography of NYFW
> Tracing how New York Fashion Week’s shifting runways reflect the city’s cycles of renewal, gentrification, and cultural change.

## 🗺️ Introduction
This is a digital geography and storytelling project designed to map, analyze, and visually narrate the evolution of New York Fashion Week (NYFW) across the city. Built with ArcGIS StoryMap and GitHub for project documentation, it provides an interactive, visually engaging exploration of how fashion and urban geography intersect.

The geography of these runways mirrors New York’s own evolution: from Manhattan’s iconic avenues to Brooklyn’s rising creative districts, each venue reflects shifting cultural, economic, and urban landscapes.

This project traces NYFW’s spatial journey through time, visualizing how runway locations move with the city’s changing identity, economic pressures, and cultural shifts. Through interactive maps, curated timelines, and narrative analysis, the StoryMap reveals how New York’s fashion landscape literally reshaped itself across decades.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Visualize the Evolution of NYFW

- Connect Fashion to Urban Geography

- Highlight Cultural and Economic Context

- Tell a Cohesive Story Through Mapping

- Show Fashion as a Reflection of Geography

## ⚠️ Limitations 

- Dataset includes only major, well-documented NYFW shows.

- Independent and emerging designers are excluded due to limited public data.

- Map reflects the documented core of NYFW, not its full decentralized network.

These limitations sharpen the focus and highlight NYFW’s major geographic arcs and evolution across the city.

## ⭐️ Features

- Era-based venue snapshots

> Each time period includes its most prominent NYFW venues.

- Contextual explanations

All presented in a visually striking, narrative-driven format designed to keep the project both engaging and informative.

## ⚙️ Method

#### Planning
- Experimented with ArcGIS StoryMap’s features to understand its layout options, mapping tools, and visual capabilities.
- Identified limitations in design flexibility—especially with aesthetics, collage formatting, and magazine-style layouts.
- Decided to integrate Canva to create cohesive, visually polished graphics that match a fashion-magazine theme.
- Finalized the project structure and chose to include the following key features:

#### Era-Based Venue Snapshots
- Researched each era/date and identified the most prominent NYFW venues.
- Collected general background information about each location.
- Gathered press photos and archival visuals for accuracy and context.
- Created visual collages using Canva to maintain a fashion-magazine aesthetic.
- Imported the collages into ArcGIS using the Sidecar feature and formatted each section with Split Screen for clear/interactive storytelling.

#### Contextual Explanations
- Researched economic conditions, cultural shifts, and major events influencing venue changes for each era.
- Condensed findings into brief, accessible explanations.
- Sourced relevant photographs supporting the context.
- Combined text and visuals in Canva to create cohesive story panels.
- Added these panels to the second page of each Sidecar section.

#### Interactive Mapping
- Added a map to the third page of each Sidecar section.
- Plotted each researched venue with precise addresses.
- Ensured all elements aligned with the project’s fashion-magazine theme.

#### Cumulative Venue Overview
- Used the Map Tour feature in ArcGIS to compile all major venues across eras.
- Input each location with its corresponding address, description, and visual.

### 🎨 Extra Feature: Design & Visuals

#### Video Collage of Runway Shows
- Researched and saved relevant runway videos from YouTube.
- Edited, shortened, and collaged them using CapCut.
- Inserted the final video into ArcGIS via the Video tool.

#### Conclusion Panel
- Designed the concluding image in Canva.
- Uploaded it into ArcGIS using the Image Gallery in Filmstrip format.

#### Photo Collage
- Used pre-downloaded project images to create a final collage.
- Inserted them through the ArcGIS Image Gallery in Jigsaw format.
